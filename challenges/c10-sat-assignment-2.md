# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category    | Needs Improvement                                                                                                | Satisfactory                                                                                                               |

## Due Date

<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due **at midnight**
before the day of the class discussion of the challenge. See the
[Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeP6DUS8Djq_A0HMllMqsSqX3a9dbcx1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386251748498665069&rtpof=true&sd=true)
for more information.

*Background*: Every year about 2 million students take the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT). The exam is
[controversial](http://www.nea.org/home/73288.htm) but [extremely
consequential](https://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0518/p13s01-legn.html).
There are many claims about the SAT, but we’re going to look at just
one: Is the SAT predictive of scholastic performance in college? It
turns out this is a fairly complicated question to assess—we’ll get an
introduction to some of the complexities.

# Obtain the Data

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Visit the [SAT and College GPA](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/case_studies/sat.html) case study page, scroll to the bottom, and click the `Open Data with Excel` button. This will allow you to download an `xls` file. Save the file to your `data` folder, load the data as `df_sat`, and perform your “first checks” against these data. Answer the questions below:

``` r
## TODO:
df_sat <- read.csv("data/sat.csv")

## TODO: Do your "first checks"
glimpse(df_sat)
```

    ## Rows: 105
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ high_GPA <dbl> 3.45, 2.78, 2.52, 3.67, 3.24, 2.10, 2.82, 2.36, 2.42, 3.51, 3…
    ## $ math_SAT <int> 643, 558, 583, 685, 592, 562, 573, 559, 552, 617, 684, 568, 6…
    ## $ verb_SAT <int> 589, 512, 503, 602, 538, 486, 548, 536, 583, 591, 649, 592, 5…
    ## $ comp_GPA <dbl> 3.76, 2.87, 2.54, 3.83, 3.29, 2.64, 2.86, 2.03, 2.81, 3.41, 3…
    ## $ univ_GPA <dbl> 3.52, 2.91, 2.40, 3.47, 3.47, 2.37, 2.40, 2.24, 3.02, 3.32, 3…

**Observations**:

- Fill in the following “data dictionary”

| Column     | Meaning                                |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| `high_GPA` | High school grade point average        |
| `math_SAT` | Math SAT score                         |
| `verb_SAT` | Verbal SAT score                       |
| `comp_GPA` | Computer science grade point average   |
| `univ_GPA` | Overall university grade point average |

- What information do we have about these students?
  - The 105 students in this study graduated from a state university
    with a B.S. in computer science.
- What kinds of information *do we not have* about these students?
  - We do not have information about their background, such as their
    ethnicity, where they went to high school at, or where they are
    from.
- Based on these missing variables, what possible effects could be
  present in the data that we would have *no way of detecting*?
  - Without knowing more information, we do not know the circumstances
    of their upbringing before going to college. They may have gone to a
    bad high school which may result in the data looking like they
    improved in college but in reality was just put in a better learning
    environment.

# Analysis with Hypothesis Testing

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

We’re going to use two complementary approaches to analyze the data, the
first based on hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients, and the
second based on fitting a regression model and interpreting the
regression coefficients.

To simplify the analysis, let’s look at a composite SAT score:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this
df_composite <-
  df_sat %>%
  mutate(both_SAT = math_SAT + verb_SAT)

glimpse(df_composite)
```

    ## Rows: 105
    ## Columns: 6
    ## $ high_GPA <dbl> 3.45, 2.78, 2.52, 3.67, 3.24, 2.10, 2.82, 2.36, 2.42, 3.51, 3…
    ## $ math_SAT <int> 643, 558, 583, 685, 592, 562, 573, 559, 552, 617, 684, 568, 6…
    ## $ verb_SAT <int> 589, 512, 503, 602, 538, 486, 548, 536, 583, 591, 649, 592, 5…
    ## $ comp_GPA <dbl> 3.76, 2.87, 2.54, 3.83, 3.29, 2.64, 2.86, 2.03, 2.81, 3.41, 3…
    ## $ univ_GPA <dbl> 3.52, 2.91, 2.40, 3.47, 3.47, 2.37, 2.40, 2.24, 3.02, 3.32, 3…
    ## $ both_SAT <int> 1232, 1070, 1086, 1287, 1130, 1048, 1121, 1095, 1135, 1208, 1…

## View 1: Correlations

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q2** Create a *single* plot that shows `univ_GPA` against *both* `high_GPA` and `both_SAT`. Visually compare the two trends.

*Hint*: One way to do this is to first *pivot* `df_composite`.

``` r
## TODO
df_composite %>% 
  pivot_longer(df_composite, 
               cols = c("high_GPA", "both_SAT"),
               names_to = "variable", values_to = "value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = univ_GPA, y = value)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free_y") +
    labs(x = "University GPA", y = "Value", color = "Variable")
```

    ## Warning in gsub(vec_paste0("^", names_prefix), "", cols): argument 'pattern' has
    ## length > 1 and only the first element will be used

![](c10-sat-assignment-2_files/figure-gfm/q2-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- What relationship do `univ_GPA` and `both_SAT` exhibit?
  - There seems to be a positive correlation between their university
    GPA and SAT score. The trend looks exponential, however, if you are
    only looking at the values with university GPA above 3, it looks
    like a vertical line.
- What relationship do `univ_GPA` and `high_GPA` exhibit?
  - There seems to be a positive correlation between their university
    GPA and highschool GPA. The trend is pretty clear and linear at the
    very top right corner and there is a gap of data points at about
    (2.75, 2.75). There appears to be some big outliers that don’t fit
    this trend.

### Hypothesis Testing with a Correlation Coefficient

<!-- ------------------------- -->

We can use the idea of hypothesis testing with a correlation
coefficient. The idea is to set our null hypothesis to the case where
there is no correlation, and test to see if the data contradict that
perspective. Formally, the null (H0) and alternative (HA) hypotheses
relating to a correlation coefficient between two variables `X, Y` are:

$$\text{H0: } \text{Corr}[X, Y] = 0$$

$$\text{HA: } \text{Corr}[X, Y] \neq 0$$

The R function `cor.test` implements such a hypothesis test under the
assumption that `X, Y` are both normally distributed. First, let’s check
to see if this assumption looks reasonable for our data.

### **q3** Plot histograms for `both_SAT, high_GPA, univ_GPA`. Which—if any—of the variables look approximately normally distributed.

``` r
bin_size <- 45

df_composite %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = both_SAT), bins = bin_size, color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
    ggtitle("Histogram of Both SAT") +
    xlab("Both SAT") +
    ylab("Frequency")
```

![](c10-sat-assignment-2_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
df_composite %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = high_GPA), bins = bin_size, color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
    ggtitle("Histogram of High School GPA") +
    xlab("High School GPA") +
    ylab("Frequency")
```

![](c10-sat-assignment-2_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
df_composite %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = univ_GPA), bins = bin_size, color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
    ggtitle("Histogram of University GPA") +
    xlab("University GPA") +
    ylab("Frequency")
```

![](c10-sat-assignment-2_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-3.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- To what extent does `both_SAT` look like a normal distribution?
  - It does not really look like a normal distribution even when the bin
    size was increased. The ends looks like a normal distribution but
    the middle is missing the height.
- To what extent does `high_GPA` look like a normal distribution?
  - This looks more like a normal distribution compared to the previous
    plot, however, it is also missing height (3.0) where we would expect
    there to be.
- To what extent does `univ_GPA` look like a normal distribution?
  - There appears to be two peaks at about 2.3-2.4 and 3.5-3.6. With the
    limited data, they both appear to be in the form of a normal
    distribution.

Keep in mind your findings as you complete q4.

### **q4** Use the function `cor.test()` to construct confidence intervals for `corr[high_GPA, univ_GPA` and `corr[both_SAT, univ_GPA]`. Answer the questions below.

``` r
## TODO: Use the function cor.test() to test the correlations between
##       high_GPA and univ_GPA, as well as between
##       both_SAT and univ_GPA
cor.test(df_composite$high_GPA, df_composite$univ_GPA)
```

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's product-moment correlation
    ## 
    ## data:  df_composite$high_GPA and df_composite$univ_GPA
    ## t = 12.632, df = 103, p-value < 2.2e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.6911690 0.8449761
    ## sample estimates:
    ##       cor 
    ## 0.7795631

``` r
cor.test(df_composite$both_SAT, df_composite$univ_GPA)
```

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's product-moment correlation
    ## 
    ## data:  df_composite$both_SAT and df_composite$univ_GPA
    ## t = 9.5339, df = 103, p-value = 8.052e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.5674824 0.7746821
    ## sample estimates:
    ##       cor 
    ## 0.6846776

**Observations**:

- Which correlations are significantly nonzero?
  - Both correlations are significantly nonzero.
- Which of `high_GPA` and `both_SAT` seems to be more strongly
  correlated with `univ_GPA`?
  - Their high school GPA seems to be more strongly correlated with
    their university GPA
- How do the results here compare with the visual you created in q2?
  - This makes sense because there is a clearer trend for high school
    and university gpa.
- Based on these results, what can we say about the predictive
  capabilities of both `high_GPA` and `both_SAT` to predict `univ_GPA`?
  - High school GPA is a better metric to look at to predict university
    GPA, however, the correlation for both metrics with university GPA
    is still pretty bad.

Finally, let’s use the bootstrap to perform the same test using
*different* assumptions.

### **q5** Use the bootstrap to approximate a confidence interval for `corr[high_GPA, univ_GPA`. Compare your results—both the estimate and confidence interval—to your results from q4.

``` r
## TODO: Use the bootstrap to compute a confidence interval for corr[high_GPA, univ_GPA]
set.seed(100)

corr <- function(data, idx)
{
  df <- data[idx, ]
  c(cor(df[, 1], df[, 5], method = 'pearson'))
}
 
bootstrap <- boot(df_composite, corr, R = 10000)
bootstrap
```

**Observations**:

- How does your estimate from q5 compare with your estimate from q4? How
  does your CI from q5 compare with your CI from q4?
  - The estimate from q4 was 0.685 with a confidence interval of 0.567
    and 0.775. The esimate from the bootstrap is 0.780 with a confidence
    interval of 0.6966 and 0.8477. The bootstrap method has a higher
    estimate than found in q4. The confidence interval values are
    different but the range are relatively the same.

*Aside*: When you use two different approximations to compute the same
quantity and get similar results, that’s an *encouraging sign*. Such an
outcome lends a bit more credibility to the results.

## View 2: Modeling

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Correlations are useful for relating two variables at a time. To study
the relationship among more variables we can instead use a fitted model.
Using a model, we can also help assess whether it is *worthwhile* to
measure a variable.

To begin, let’s first split the data into training and validation sets.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
set.seed(101)

df_train <-
  df_composite %>%
  rowid_to_column() %>%
  slice_sample(n = 80)

df_validate <-
  df_composite %>%
  rowid_to_column() %>%
  anti_join(
    .,
    df_train,
    by = "rowid"
  )
```

### Hypothesis Testing with a Model

<!-- ------------------------- -->

We can combine the ideas of hypothesis testing with a model. Using a
model, we can express our hypotheses in terms of the model parameters.
For instance, if we were interested in whether $X$ has an affect on $Y$,
we might set up a model:

$$Y_i = \beta X_i + \epsilon_i$$

With the hypotheses:

$$\text{H0}: \beta = 0$$

$$\text{HA}: \beta \neq 0$$

In this case, we’re testing for whether $X$ has a significant effect on
$Y$. Let’s apply this idea to relating the variables `univ_GPA` and
`high_GPA`. Luckily R has built-in tools to construct a confidence
interval on the $\beta$’s in a regression \[1\]; we’ll simply use those
tools rather than do it by hand.

### **q6** Fit a linear model predicting `univ_GPA` with the predictor `both_SAT`. Assess the model to determine how effective a predictor `both_SAT` is for `univ_GPA`. Interpret the resulting confidence interval for the coefficient on `both_SAT`.

``` r
## TODO: Fit a model of univ_GPA on the predictor both_SAT
fit_basic <- lm(univ_GPA ~ both_SAT, data = df_composite)

## NOTE: The following computes confidence intervals on regression coefficients
fit_basic %>%
  tidy(
    conf.int = TRUE,
    conf.level = 0.99
  )
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 7
    ##   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
    ##   <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept) -0.172    0.352       -0.487 6.27e- 1 -1.10      0.753  
    ## 2 both_SAT     0.00274  0.000287     9.53  8.05e-16  0.00198   0.00349

**Observations**:

- What is the confidence interval on the coefficient of `both_SAT`? Is
  this coefficient significantly different from zero?
  - The confidence interval is 0.001984016 and 0.003491187. These
    numbers are small, but are not zero.
- By itself, how well does `both_SAT` predict `univ_GPA`?
  - Based on the information above, it appears both_SAT does not predict
    univ_GPA very well, considering how high the p-value is.

Remember from `e-model03-interp-warnings` that there are challenges with
interpreting regression coefficients! Let’s investigate that idea
further.

### **q7** Fit a model predicting `univ_GPA` using both `high_GPA` and `both_SAT`. Compare the prediction accuracy and hypothesis test results.

``` r
## TODO: Fit and assess models with predictors both_SAT + high_GPA, and high_GPA alone
fit_basic <- lm(univ_GPA ~ both_SAT + high_GPA, data = df_composite)

## NOTE: The following computes confidence intervals on regression coefficients
fit_basic %>%
  tidy(
    conf.int = TRUE,
    conf.level = 0.99
  )
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 7
    ##   term        estimate std.error statistic       p.value  conf.low conf.high
    ##   <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>         <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept) 0.540     0.318         1.70 0.0924        -0.294      1.37   
    ## 2 both_SAT    0.000792  0.000387      2.05 0.0432        -0.000224   0.00181
    ## 3 high_GPA    0.541     0.0837        6.47 0.00000000353  0.322      0.761

**Observations**:

- How well do these models perform, compared to the one you built in q6?
  - This model appears to perform slightly better than the previous
    model in 16 because the p-value is one order of magnitude smaller.
- What is the confidence interval on the coefficient of `both_SAT` when
  including `high_GPA` as a predictor?? Is this coefficient
  significantly different from zero?
  - When including high_GPA, the confidence interval range has shrunk
    compared to q5, especially the lower confidence interval. However,
    the upper confidence interval is not zero.
- How do the hypothesis test results compare with the results in q6?
  - Since the p-value is above 0.05 for both models, we cannot reject
    the null hypothesis. However, it is important to note the modelin q7
    is better are predicting the value university GPA.

## Synthesize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Before closing, let’s synthesize a bit from the analyses above.

### **q8** Using the results from all previous q’s, answer the following questions.

**Observations**:

- Between `both_SAT` and `high_GPA`, which single variable would you
  choose to predict `univ_GPA`? Why?
  - I would choose high_GPA to predict univ_GPA because looking at the
    model from q7, there appears to be a correlation between univ_GPA
    and high_GPA. The estimate for both_SAT is essentially 0 while the
    estimate for high_GPA is non-zero. This means that the value for
    univ_GPA depends highly on high_GPA and not as much on both_SAT.
- Is `both_SAT` an effective predictor of `univ_GPA`? What specific
  pieces of evidence do you have in favor of `both_SAT` being effective?
  What specific pieces of evidence do you have against?
  - both_SAT is not an effective predictor of univ_GPA. This can be seen
    in the models built in q6 and q7. The p-value in q6 tells us there
    is not a big correlation between the two. The model built in q7
    shows that both_SAT does not contribute significantly to value of
    univ_GPA as the estimate value is 0.0008 while the estimate for
    high_GPA is 0.541.
