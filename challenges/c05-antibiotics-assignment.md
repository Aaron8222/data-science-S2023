Antibiotics
================

*Purpose*: Creating effective data visualizations is an *iterative*
process; very rarely will the first graph you make be the most
effective. The most effective thing you can do to be successful in this
iterative process is to *try multiple graphs* of the same data.

Furthermore, judging the effectiveness of a visual is completely
dependent on *the question you are trying to answer*. A visual that is
totally ineffective for one question may be perfect for answering a
different question.

In this challenge, you will practice *iterating* on data visualization,
and will anchor the *assessment* of your visuals using two different
questions.

*Note*: Please complete your initial visual design **alone**. Work on
both of your graphs alone, and save a version to your repo *before*
coming together with your team. This way you can all bring a diversity
of ideas to the table!

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

*Background*: The data\[1\] we study in this challenge report the
[*minimum inhibitory
concentration*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration)
(MIC) of three drugs for different bacteria. The smaller the MIC for a
given drug and bacteria pair, the more practical the drug is for
treating that particular bacteria. An MIC value of *at most* 0.1 is
considered necessary for treating human patients.

These data report MIC values for three antibiotics—penicillin,
streptomycin, and neomycin—on 16 bacteria. Bacteria are categorized into
a genus based on a number of features, including their resistance to
antibiotics.

# Visualization

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Prototype 5 visuals

To start, construct **5 qualitatively different visualizations of the
data** `df_antibiotics`. These **cannot** be simple variations on the
same graph; for instance, if two of your visuals could be made identical
by calling `coord_flip()`, then these are *not* qualitatively different.

For all five of the visuals, you must show information on *all 16
bacteria*. For the first two visuals, you must *show all variables*.

*Hint 1*: Try working quickly on this part; come up with a bunch of
ideas, and don’t fixate on any one idea for too long. You will have a
chance to refine later in this challenge.

*Hint 2*: The data `df_antibiotics` are in a *wide* format; it may be
helpful to `pivot_longer()` the data to make certain visuals easier to
construct.

#### Visual 1 (All variables)

In this visual you must show *all three* effectiveness values for *all
16 bacteria*. You must also show whether or not each bacterium is Gram
positive or negative.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_antibiotics_pivot <- df_antibiotics %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("in"),
    names_to = "antibiotic",
    values_to = "MIC"
  )
df_antibiotics_pivot
```

    ##  4 Brucella abortus      negative penicillin     1    
    ##  5 Brucella abortus      negative streptomycin   2    
    ##  6 Brucella abortus      negative neomycin       0.02 
    ##  7 Bacillus anthracis    positive penicillin     0.001
    ##  8 Bacillus anthracis    positive streptomycin   0.01 
    ##  9 Bacillus anthracis    positive neomycin       0.007
    ## 10 Diplococcus pneumonia positive penicillin     0.005
    ## # … with 38 more rows

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.1-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 2 (All variables)

In this visual you must show *all three* effectiveness values for *all
16 bacteria*. You must also show whether or not each bacterium is Gram
positive or negative.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
df_antibiotics_pivot %>%
  ggplot(aes(antibiotic, bacteria, fill = MIC)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_continuous(trans = "log10") +

  facet_grid(~gram)
```

#### Visual 3 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
df_antibiotics_pivot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = MIC, fill = bacteria)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
    coord_polar("y", start=0) +
    facet_grid(~antibiotic)
```

#### Visual 4 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
df_antibiotics_pivot %>%
  ggplot(aes(antibiotic, MIC, color = bacteria, group = bacteria)) +

#### Visual 5 (Some variables)

bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

### **q2** Assess your visuals

There are **two questions** below; use your five visuals to help answer
both Guiding Questions. Note that you must also identify which of your
five visuals were most helpful in answering the questions.

*Hint 1*: It’s possible that *none* of your visuals is effective in
answering the questions below. You may need to revise one or more of
your visuals to answer the questions below!

*Hint 2*: It’s **highly unlikely** that the same visual is the most
effective at helping answer both guiding questions. **Use this as an
opportunity to think about why this is.**

#### Guiding Question 1

> How do the three antibiotics vary in their effectiveness against
> bacteria of different genera and Gram stain?

*Observations* - What is your response to the question above? - The
antibiotic neomycin was effective against most bacteria genera, with it
being extremely effective against staphylococcus genus. The antibiotic
streptomycin is only effective against 4 of the bacteria strains.
Penicillin seems to target specific bacteria because it is extremely
effective against Streptococcus genus, but does little to none to others
such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is also
effective against Staphylococcus genus, Diplococcus pneumonia, and
Bacillus anthracis. In general, it appears neomycin and streptomycin is
most effective against positive gram bacteria, but is also effective
against negative gram bacteria. Penicillin is only effective against
positive gram bacteria.

- Which of your visuals above (1 through 5) is **most effective** at
  helping to answer this question?
  - Visual 2 was the most effective at helping answer this question.
- Why?
  - I found that it was the easiest to tell the MIC value for a given
    bacteria and antibiotic combination. Unlike visual 1 or 3, I could
    just correlate a darker color to being more effective and a lighter
    color to being less effective. It also shows the gram stain so it
    was easy to compare antibiotic effectiveness against bacteria and
    gram stain.

#### Guiding Question 2

In 1974 *Diplococcus pneumoniae* was renamed *Streptococcus pneumoniae*,
and in 1984 *Streptococcus fecalis* was renamed *Enterococcus fecalis*
\[2\].

> Why was *Diplococcus pneumoniae* was renamed *Streptococcus
> pneumoniae*?

*Observations* - What is your response to the question above? -
Diplococcus pneumoniae was renamed to Streptococcus pneumoniae because
its response to the three antibiotics is very similar to the two
Streptococcus genus bacterium, which means that Diplococcus pneumoniae
is most likely related to Strepococcus rather than Diplococcus. Like the
bacteria in the Streptococcus genus, Diplococcus pneumoniae, penicillin
is the most effective antibiotic, where most other bacteria do not
respond to it at all.

- Which of your visuals above (1 through 5) is **most effective** at
  helping to answer this question?
  - Visual 3 was the most effective at helping answer this question.
- Why?
  - Unlike visual 2, it is easier to recognize small differences in MIC
    values because the value is correlated to the size of a dot rather
    than a minute change in shading. It is a lot easier to compare the
    sizes of MIC values to other bacteria.
