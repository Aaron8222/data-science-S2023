*Purpose*: When studying physical problems, there is an important
distinction between *error* and *uncertainty*. The primary purpose of
this challenge is to dip our toes into these factors by analyzing a real
dataset.

## Due Date

<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due **at midnight**
before the day of the class discussion of the challenge. See the
[Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeP6DUS8Djq_A0HMllMqsSqX3a9dbcx1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386251748498665069&rtpof=true&sd=true)

``` r
# Libraries

library(googlesheets4)

url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1av_SXn4j0-4Rk0mQFik3LLr-uf0YdA06i3ugE6n-Zdo/edit?usp=sharing"

# Parameters
LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM    <- 299792.458 # Exact speed of light in a vacuum (km / s)
LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON <- 299944.00  # Michelson's speed estimate (km / s)
LIGHTSPEED_PM        <- 51         # Michelson error estimate (km / s)
```

*Background*: In 1879 Albert Michelson led an experimental campaign to
measure the speed of light. His approach was a development upon the
method of Foucault\[3\], and resulted in a new estimate of
$v_0 = 299944 \pm 51$ kilometers per second (in a vacuum). This is very
close to the modern *exact* value of 2.9979246^{5}. In this challenge,
you will analyze Michelson’s original data, and explore some of the
factors associated with his experiment.

I’ve already copied Michelson’s data from his 1880 publication; the code
chunk below will load these data from a public googlesheet.

*Aside*: The speed of light is *exact* (there is **zero error** in the
value `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`) because the meter is actually
[*defined*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#Speed_of_light_definition)
in terms of the speed of light!

### **q1** Re-create the following table (from Michelson (1880), pg. 139) using `df_michelson` and `dplyr`. Note that your values *will not* match those of Michelson *exactly*; why might this be?

| Distinctness | n   | MeanVelocity |
|--------------|-----|--------------|
| 3            | 46  | 299860       |

``` r
## TODO: Compute summaries
df_q1 <- df_michelson %>%
  select(Distinctness, Velocity) %>%
  group_by(Distinctness) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), MeanVelocity = mean(Velocity))
df_q1
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 3
    ##   Distinctness     n MeanVelocity
    ##   <fct>        <int>        <dbl>
    ## 1 1               15      299808

    ## 3 3               46      299862.

``` r
df_q1 %>%
  arrange(desc(Distinctness)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Distinctness |   n | MeanVelocity |
|:-------------|----:|-------------:|
| 3            |  46 |     299861.7 |
| 2            |  39 |     299858.5 |
| 1            |  15 |     299808.0 |

**Observations**: - Write your observations here! - The number or
occurrences (n) for both sets of data are the same, however the mean
velocities differ slightly. - Why might your table differ from
Michelson’s? - This could be caused by rounding values during
calculations because there wasn’t sophisticated devices to easily
calculate this stuff during Michelson’s time.

The `Velocity` values in the dataset are the speed of light *in air*;
Michelson introduced a couple of adjustments to estimate the speed of
light in a vacuum. In total, he added $+92$ km/s to his mean estimate
for `VelocityVacuum` (from Michelson (1880), pg. 141). While the
following isn’t fully rigorous ($+92$ km/s is based on the mean
temperature), we’ll simply apply this correction to all the observations
in the dataset.

### **q2** Create a new variable `VelocityVacuum` with the $+92$ km/s adjustment to `Velocity`. Assign this new dataframe to `df_q2`.

``` r
## TODO: Adjust the data, assign to df_q2
df_q2 <- df_michelson %>%
  select(everything()) %>%
  mutate(VelocityVacuum = Velocity + 92)

df_q2
```

As part of his study, Michelson assessed the various potential sources
of error, and provided his best-guess for the error in his
speed-of-light estimate. These values are provided in
`LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON`—his nominal estimate—and
`LIGHTSPEED_PM`—plus/minus bounds on his estimate. Put differently,
Michelson believed the true value of the speed-of-light probably lay
between `LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON - LIGHTSPEED_PM` and
`LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON + LIGHTSPEED_PM`.

Let’s introduce some terminology:\[2\]

- **Error** is the difference between a true value and an estimate of
  that value; for instance `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON`.
- **Uncertainty** is an analyst’s *assessment* of the error.

Since a “true” value is often not known in practice, one generally does
not know the error. The best they can do is quantify their degree of
uncertainty. We will learn some means of quantifying uncertainty in this
class, but for many real problems uncertainty includes some amount of
human judgment.\[2\]

### **q3** Compare Michelson’s speed of light estimate against the modern speed of light value. Is Michelson’s estimate of the error (his uncertainty) greater or less than the true error?

``` r
## TODO: Compare Michelson's estimate and error against the true value
true_error = abs(LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON)
true_error
```

    ## [1] 151.542

``` r
LIGHTSPEED_PM
```

    ## [1] 51

``` r
true_error - LIGHTSPEED_PM
```

    ## [1] 100.542

**Observations**: - Is Michelson’s estimate of the error (his
uncertainty) greater or less than the true error? - Michelson’s estimate
of the error is less than the true error. - Make a quantitative
comparison between Michelson’s uncertainty and his error. - The true
error is 151.542 m/s, while Michelson’s is 51 m/s. The difference in
value is 100.542 m/s.

The following plot shows all of Michelson’s data as a [control
chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart); this sort of plot
is common in manufacturing, where it is used to help determine if a
manufacturing process is under [statistical
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control).
Each dot is one of Michelson’s measurements, and the grey line connects
the mean taken for each day. The same plot also shows simulated data
using a probability model. We’ll get into statistics later in the
course; for now, let’s focus on understanding what real and simulated
data tend to look like.

### **q4** Inspect the following plot with the `Real` Michelson data and `Simulated` data from a probability model. Document the similarities and differences between the data under *observe* below.

``` r
## Note: No need to edit this chunk!
## Calibrate simulated data
v_mean <-
  df_q2 %>%
  summarize(m = mean(VelocityVacuum)) %>%
  pull(m)
v_sd <-
  df_q2 %>%
  summarize(s = sd(VelocityVacuum)) %>%
  pull(s)

## Visualize
set.seed(101)
df_q2 %>%
  mutate(Simulated = rnorm(n(), mean = v_mean, sd = v_sd)) %>%
  rename(Real = VelocityVacuum) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(Simulated, Real),
    names_to = "source",
    values_to = "velocity"
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(Date, velocity)) +
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON,
    linetype = "dotted"
  ) +
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON - LIGHTSPEED_PM,
    linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON + LIGHTSPEED_PM,
    linetype = "dashed"
  ) +

  geom_line(
    data = . %>%
      group_by(Date, source) %>%
      summarize(velocity_mean = mean(velocity)),
    mapping = aes(y = velocity_mean),
    color = "grey50"
  ) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(y = velocity),
    size = 0.8
  ) +

  facet_grid(source~.) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Date of Measurement (1879)",
    y = "Velocity (in Vacuum)"
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'Date'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

**Observations**: Similarities - The overall trend for both are very
similar in that they are horizontal. Most of the data for both fit
between the two dashed lines. Differences - There are differences in
individual data points on a given day. On one day, the actual data may
be clustered while the simulated data may not be and more spread out and
vice versa. Looking at the data collected on June 23, the real data
points are closer together and gather near the upper dotted line, while
the simulated data points are spread out and range greatly.

### **q5** You have access to a few other variables. Construct a few visualizations of `VelocityVacuum` against these other factors. Are there other patterns in the data that might help explain the difference between Michelson’s estimate and `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`?

**Observations**:

``` r
df_q2 %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Temp, y = VelocityVacuum, color = Distinctness)) +
  ggtitle("Velocity vs Temperature")
```

![](c02-michelson-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-visualizations-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
df_q2 %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Distinctness, y = VelocityVacuum)) +
  ggtitle("Velocity vs Distinctness")
```

![](c02-michelson-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-visualizations-2.png)<!-- -->

- Make sure to record observations on your graphs! Note: 3 = good, 2 =
  fair, 1 = poor The first plot is a scatter plot showing the velocity
  vs the temperature with the distinctness displayed. It appears the
  temperature does not effect the velocity value. There may be a very
  slight trend line upward but it is inconclusive with the data
  available. All the 3 distinctness values are clustered at a higher
  temperature, while mixed for 1 and 2.

The second plot is a box plot showing the velocity variation for each
distinction. It appears there is more variation in the velocity value in
the good category than the fair or poor. However, there is a higher
range (max - min value) present in the fair and poor category. The
average velocity for good distinctness is closer to the true value
compared to the other two. Both of these factors (variation and poor
distinctness) would have brought Michelson’s estimate down.
